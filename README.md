# DesignPatterns with Modern CPP

* This repository consists the codes that were demonstrated in the online Udemy Corse on Design Patterns using ModernC++  in this link : https://www.udemy.com/course/patterns-cplusplus/
* I have modified some of the codes for the sake of my own understanding using smart pointers, classes with private members as opposed to structs with all public members as demonstrated by the author in the course. 
* Wherever necessary the `CMakeLists.txt` file is included in the repository to build the individual Pattern with multiple files
* Patterns with single `.cpp` and `.hpp` have no CMake file included. They can be easily built on the command line or using an IDE

### NOTE : The course has a huge drawback of not having any UML Diagrams explaining how the coupling is broken using the pattern.
